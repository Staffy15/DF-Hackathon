# IDFD-Challenge
## Indian DeepFake Detection Challenge


## Overview
Deepfake refers to facially manipulated images and vidoes of people. The technology is growing fast and is a greatest threat to the dignity of common man. With advancement in AI technology, deepfake creation techniques are also improving. Since this creation and detection is a two-party game which is never going to end, we are organizing a competition to provide a benchmark this game between user-friendly generation techniques and most efficient detection techniques for the same. The outcome of this competition would be a set of Indian deepfakes which will help the research community and a detection technique for the generated dataset.

## Competition Stages

### First round: Deepfake Creation:
In this phase, a team is needed to capture images and generate fake images from them using the given code.
1. Collect samples of real images and 3-second videos of different subjects. Each image and video must exhibit face area of single person, positioned at centre position. No two teams should have same set of images/videos or images/videos of same subject. For each subject, maximum 50 images and 50 videos are allowed. 
2. Generate deepfake images through below given methods: 
   - First Order Motion Model (Use this colab link ........)
   - Install Mobile Application, FaceApp and use feature FaceSwap there. Input different pairs of images as source and target image.
   - 
4. (...................................Link). Real image dataset is provided here. Along with this, use data collected in Step 1. 

At Level 1, teams are evaluated on the basis of diversity and quantity of subjects captured and deepfaked.

### Second round: Deepfake Detection:
DIC invites B.E. and M.E. students of UIET, Panjab University, Chandigarh to take part in IDF (Indian DeepFake) Detection Challenge. Maximum 4 members can join in a team. This challenge exhibit three levels; performance of team is evaluated after each level and elimination is done accordingly. Prize distribution would be there for winners of each level.
Level-1:
In first level, each team has to generate deepfake images using the code provided through this portal. Steps to complete level 1 are as follows:
1.	Collect samples of real images of different subjects after getting a consent form signed (.........Link). Each image must exhibit face areas of single subject, positioned at centre position. Subjects should not overlap amongst different teams. For each subject, maximum 50 images are allowed. 
2.	Generate deepfake images through this code: (...................................Link). Real image dataset is provided here. Along with this, use data collected in Step 1. 
At Level 1, teams are evaluated on the basis of diversity and quantity of subjects captured and deepfaked.
Level-2:
Top 50% teams from Level-2 would be admitted to Level-2. In second level, perform the following steps:
1.	Arrange real and fake samples in separate folders with
